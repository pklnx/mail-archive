# Workflow

Roles: maintainer (human), coordinator (Claude: orders the backlog, plans, delegates, merges), implementer (one PR each), reviewer, plan-reviewer (never the planner). Agents: `.claude/agents/`; coordination and models: [pklnx/dev-process](https://github.com/pklnx/dev-process). All in Claude sessions on the subscription; no Claude GitHub Action.

Language: German with the maintainer; English on GitHub and in code. Every GitHub text ends with `— Claude, <role>`; no model names on GitHub.

## Coordinator autonomy
The coordinator decides alone and reports afterwards: UI wording, technical trade-offs, small product details inside an approved goal, tightening security. It asks the maintainer (AskUserQuestion, recommendation first, questions bundled) about new goals and milestone scope, releases, and anything that widens access or weakens security or privacy, including `security.md` guarantees. It reports only at milestones and blockers, works toward the goal instead of asking for confirmation, and records its decisions for later review ("Coordinator decisions" in plans, PR and issue comments). Agents stop and report only for real product questions; technical choices they make and document.

## Ticket flow
1. Issue (template).
2. Coordinator or maintainer labels `plan` → `## Plan` comment (approach, files, data model, external services, tests, open questions, size); label becomes `review`.
3. A plan-reviewer agent reviews independently; it or the maintainer replaces `review` with `ready`. Only `ready` issues are built.
4. Several parts: one sub-issue per part, created with the plan, titled "<what> (#N, part K)", linked as GitHub sub-issue (by `id`, not number). The main issue's `ready` covers them; it closes with the last part.
5. One branch and PR per part; body "Closes #<sub>." and "Part K of #N.".
6. Review: a session reviewer for all app code. Risky PRs (deletes, schema changes (`db-migration`), rewriting user data, the serving layer: static files, response headers, CSP, routing) also get a second, independent session reviewer who has not seen the first; the coordinator marks them `second-review`. No app code (docs, CI, test-only): one session review (Sonnet) and green required checks.
7. Merge: approving review and green required checks; squash merge pinned to the reviewed head SHA. Never auto-merge; never change rulesets or repo settings. A PR touching the secret scan's allowlist or configuration (files: `docs/development/process.md`, "4. Pull request") merges only after the maintainer's explicit OK, asked via AskUserQuestion with the changed entries (file, rule id, path or fingerprint), never secret values; the OK is noted on the PR.
8. Releases are planned in milestones (`docs/development/process.md`, "Milestones").

Blocking in reviews only: crash, data loss or corruption, hang, wrong result in a main function, security or privacy problem, broken main flow, missing or failing test for new behaviour, plan or maintainer decision violated. Anything else: a `followup` issue if the reviewer names a realistic near-term case, else stays in the review.

## GitHub operations
Commands per operation: `.claude/github-operations.md`, read before the first GitHub write. An MCP `issue_write` labels update replaces the whole set.

## Rules
- Tests never touch real user data, credentials or the network. Secrets only in the secret store, never in chat or files.
- Every behaviour change has tests; a bug fix has a regression test that fails without the fix. Tests wait for signals, never for time.
- Locally run only the tests of what changed; CI runs everything.
- Plans state the memory and CPU cost on the target hardware of a hosted instance, 4 GB RAM and 2 cores, and stay within it.
- A PR that changes the web UI updates the affected docs screenshots (`make docs-screenshots`) and docs text in the same PR.
- Agents never watch CI: push, open the PR, report; the coordinator waits for checks (GitHub operations).
- ≤3 tickets in parallel, ≤2 PRs in CI at a time.
- A flaky-test rerun gets a row in `docs/development/flaky-tests.md`; a test listed twice is fixed right away.
- After 3 review rounds that keep finding new holes in a heuristic: stop patching; rebuild it on a principle or give the maintainer options.

## Session handover
Start: read `.claude/HANDOVER.md`; follow-ups are open `followup` issues, queried when needed. End: replace its state, never append.
